                <span class="cs-header">Yunus Mumuni</span>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    Yunus Mumuni is a passionate technologist, community advocate, and multi-sport athlete from
                    Kalamazoo, Michigan. With a lifelong curiosity for technology, Yunus began coding in high school,
                    building everything from personal websites to a full-fledged point-of-sale system for a local
                    business. His early interest in software development was matched by his academic dedication—he
                    graduated with a 4.2 GPA while excelling in football, soccer, and rugby. Yunus brings the same
                    discipline and creativity to his work today, where he focuses on solving real-world problems through
                    smart, accessible technology solutions.
                </p>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    Beyond his technical skills, Yunus has been deeply involved in programs that reflect his commitment
                    to equity and community growth. He served as a mental health ambassador and participated in the
                    Youth Juvenile Justice program, where he worked to address racial disparities in the legal system.
                    Yunus was also a proud member of the Wealth Developers youth program at Greenleaf Trust, where he
                    gained valuable insights into financial literacy, entrepreneurship, and generational wealth
                    building. These experiences have shaped his holistic approach to technology—one that considers not
                    just functionality, but impact. With a strong foundation in coding, leadership, and advocacy, Yunus
                    is dedicated to building tools and systems that empower individuals and uplift communities.
